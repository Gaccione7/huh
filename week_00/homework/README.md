# HOMEWORK: Reading HTML and CSS!

![code](http://www.keepcalmstudio.com/_gallery/300/12zkOQx.png)

Welcome to FEWD! We hope you will have an excellent time during your time here!

For your first homework assignment, you've been provided a portfolio site -- sort of like the one you'll have to make during your time here. Your task is to read through the HTML and CSS for the site, make some minor modifications to it, and then answer the questions below.

If you don't understand everything that's going on, don't worry -- you're here to learn, and we're here to teach! This site puts into practice many of the principles you'll learn in the next few weeks. Think of it as the reading before a lecture -- you might not understand everything, but you've seen the concepts before.

Remember, to open the code in your code editor, here's what you'll do:

- Open the `homework` folder in Finder (or Windows Explorer)
- Drag the `portfolio-site` folder into the Sublime Text window
- Voila!
- You can open `index.html` in Chrome.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

You have answered the following questions in your issue ticket:

1. What types of HTML elements are in this page? Which of these are new to you?
2. Find where the stylesheets are linked. There are two of them. `style.css` has all of our styles in it, but what does `reset.css` do? Try taking out `reset.css`. Then try putting `reset.css` above `style.css`.
3. Find the div with class `clearfix` and remove it from the page. What happens? What's in the css in that style rule?
4. How are the images under recent projects included?
5. When does the profile picture show up? How is that managed?
6. Write four questions of your own about the code here.

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- An [issue ticket](https://github.com/ga-students/FEWD-NYC-1.17.18/issues/new) created on _this repo_.
- Your issue ticket contains answers to the questions above.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions.
