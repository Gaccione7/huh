# Git & Version Control

### Learning Objectives:
- Define a version control system (Git) and explain its benefits
- Initialize a local git repository and explain what it does for a developer
- Push local changes to a remote git repository using the GitHub app
- Pull changes from a remote git repository to a local computer using the GitHub app
- Connect local repositories to remote repositories using the GitHub app

## Why Git?

Git as a tool is _vital_ to developers. GitHub allows developers to work collaboratively on the same codebase without running into problems. 

## Important Vocabulary

- **git**: A version control system that saves the state of your project's files and folders. Basically, it takes a snapshot of what all your files look like at any given moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
- **repository**: a central location in which data is stored and managed. Often shortened to "repo".
- **clone**: download data from the cloud to your local machine
- **commit**: save a version of your project to git
- **GitHub**: A platform that makes it easy to manage git repositories.
    - VERY IMPORTANT: git and github are **not synonymous**!!

## üöÄ Let's Practice!

Follow the instructions in the lab. If you get lost, ask the people around you for help, or ask one of the instructors!

1. Make a new folder called `FEWD` somewhere you can find it. Maybe your desktop?
2. Log on to [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and press the big green button for "New Repository".
3. Finish setting up the repo by adding a name to the repository. The default settings are fine. Name your repository whatever you want!
4. Click on the "set up in desktop" button.
5. When the app opens, a message should pop up that says "Clone As" with the name of our new repository pre-entered. üö® IF IT DOES NOT! Please raise your hand and see what the instructors have to say! üö®


6. Save the repository to your new `FEWD` folder.
7. Open your `FEWD` folder up in Finder. Drag the icon for your new repository's folder into Sublime Text and create the following:
    - An `index.html` file
    - a `css` folder
    - a `style.css` file within the `css` folder
8. Go back to the GitHub app and select the "changes" tab. As a "commit message" for now, you can just put ‚Äúsyncing my new repository!‚Äù, but as you do other projects you will want to commit frequently and your commit messages might look like ‚Äúchanged the background color and logo size per client‚Äôs request.‚Äù
9. Hit the "Commit and sync" button at the bottom and then the "Publish" button.
10. Go back to GitHub.com and refresh your repository page. You should now see the cookie recipe's files inside.

## Our Class Repo

Now that you've seen how to create a new repo and add files to it, it's time to see how we'll be using the class repo to receive files and code from the instructors!

Go ahead and clone the class repo into your `FEWD` folder. Here's the link: `https://github.com/ga-students/FEWD-NYC-1.17.18`

You won't be able to add your own files to this repo, but you'll be able to get any files that we upload.

# IN CONCLUSION!

- Git is a tool that's used by developers for collaboration and version control.
- GitHub is a place where git repositories can be viewed online. Git and GitHub are not the same.
- We will be using Git throughout the class for homework submissions, class notes, etc.
